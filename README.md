## Description

The main motivation to creating this fictional mock up website was to better understand css selectors and attributes. I've learned that css is vital to creating the visual apperance of html's logic. Throuhghout the project, I faced many obstacles regarding semantic elements with html, making the html more readable for the user. In addition, I struggled a considerable amount trying to simplify the repeating codes in css and identifying how to use the css attributes to conect to html properly. This project is premature, there is much to apply to the website. In the future, I would like to be able to have the nav links go into different pages of its topic.

## Installation
